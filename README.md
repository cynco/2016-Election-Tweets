# 2016-Election-Tweets
Project to analyze tweets about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton leading up to the 2016 presidential election.

The Twitter-data-retrieval jupyter notebook retrieved data from the Twitter API every two days from October 1st until November 8th. The data is aggregated, tidyied, and saved in .csv format.

The Twitter-data-analysis jupyter notebook reads in the .csv data and performs exploratory analysis to ensure the integrity of the data. The temporal variations in the data are explored for insights about how twitter activity correlates to election events such as the 2nd presidential debate.
